# About Me
Hello eveyone,
My name is Miriam. I am a first year MURP concentrating in Environmental Analysis and Policy. I am from Los Angeles. Spent most of my childhood in the Arts District neighborhood in downtown. I studied Environmental Studies in undergrad and went on to work at a nonprofit that ran archaeology and environmental field research programs in the US and abroad. I am generally interested in exploring work in climate adaptation in Los Angeles and specifically in urban food systems and nature-based solutions that can make cities more habitable and biodiverse. Most recently I've become more curious in stormwater infrastructure. 
# Course Description
My understanding is that this course teaches students the coding language (Python) to visually demonstrate data in maps. A very critical tool in the world of urban planning given that the field is all about making recommendations to transform spaces for various social or environmnetal objectives. 
# Course Objectives
I am a visual learner so I am excited by the prospect of gaining the tools to convey data spatially and visual storytelling tools. I enjoy using maps to understand the scale and context of a narrative. 
# Project Ideas
Maps of...
- all the permeable surfaces in Los Angeles that contribute to groundwater replenishment
- urban farms, food distributions, compost locations
- transportation distances of food
